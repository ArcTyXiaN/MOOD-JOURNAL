# MOOD-JOURNAL

Welcome to **Mood Journal**, a simple, personal tool designed to help you keep track of your emotions, reflect on your days, and understand your mental patterns over time.

This project isn’t trying to be flashy or overcomplicated. It’s just here to make emotional tracking easy and meaningful — whether you’re logging a quick thought or diving deep into your feelings.

## Why I Built This

Sometimes, emotions get blurry. You think you know how you’ve been feeling, but memory is unreliable. This journal is a space to be honest with yourself and, over time, spot trends you’d never notice otherwise.

It started as a personal experiment, but I realized others could benefit from it too. So here it is, open and ready to grow with your ideas.
